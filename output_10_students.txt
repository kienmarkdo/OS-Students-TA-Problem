================== Sleeping TA Simulation ==================

Total number of students who require help: 10

The TA must help all 10 students.

Each student will attempt to get the TA's help or sit in the waiting area until it is their turn to be helped by the TA.   
Once a student receives help from the TA, the student will leave and never come back.

If a student arrives and sees that there are no seats left in the waiting area, the student will leave and come back later.
Each time the student comes and sees that the waiting area is full, the student will leave for a longer period of time.
