 * Assignment 3 - Thread Synchronization
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * This problem simulates the Sleeping Teaching Assistant Problem as follows.
 * 
 * 1. The problem consists of one TA, one chair in the TA's office for a
 * student, and three chairs outside of the TA's office for students to wait
 * until the TA is ready to serve the next student.
 * 
 * 2. If a student arrives, verifies that the waiting area is empty, checks the
 * TA's office, and sees that the TA is sleeping, the student will wake the TA
 * up and sit on the chair in the office.
 * 
 * 3. If a student arrives, verifies that the waiting area is empty, checks the
 * TA's office, and sees that the TA is currently occupied with another student,
 * the student will wait by sitting in one of the three available chairs in the
 * waiting area.
 * 
 * 4. If a student arrives, sees that there are students in the waiting area,
 * the student will have a seat and wait.
 * 
 * 5. if a student arrives, sees that there the waiting area is full, the
 * student will leave.
 * 
 * 6. If the TA finishes answering a student's questions, the TA will check the
 * waiting area for any students. If there is a student, the TA will call a
 * student into the office. if there are no students, the TA will go back to
 * sleep.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * PROBLEM 1: Deadlock
 * --- There may be a scenario where a student ends up waiting for the TA, and
 * the TA is waiting for a student. That is, the TA is sleeping while a student
 * in the waiting area is waiting to be called in by the TA.
 * 
 * Problem 2: Starvation
 * --- May happen when a student is in the waiting area and never gets called,
 * if the TA calls in a student at random.
 * 
 * Solution: Semaphores, mutex (binary semaphore), integer counters
 * --- Seat counter
 * ------ Counts the number of seats available in the waiting area
 * --- Seat mutex:
 * ------ A seat counter can only be modified by the student who holds the mutex
 * --- TA status semaphore:
 * ------ Tells the status of the TA (available or busy)
 * --- TA attention semaphore:
 * ------ Represents which student gets to have the TA's attention
 * ------ Students can join the queue by holding the current semaphore's value
